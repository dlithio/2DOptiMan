{"name":"2DOptiMan","tagline":"A MATLAB program to generate an Optimal Mesh for 2D (un)stable Manifolds","body":"# What does this software do?\r\nThis project contains the files necessary to compute the stable or unstable manifold of a vector field using MATLAB, and then create a vtk file to be read by Paraview for visualization. Specifically, we consider the system \\\\( \\frac{du}{dt} = F(u(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t)) \\\\) with a fixed point where \\\\(  F(x_0, y_0 , z_0 ) = 0 \\\\). In the case of a stable manifold, we find the set of points such that as \\\\( t \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\), \\\\( u(t) -> (x_0,y_0,z_0) \\\\). In the case of the unstable manifold, we find the set of points such that as \\\\( t \\rightarrow -\\infty \\\\), \\\\( u(t) -> (x_0,y_0,z_0) \\\\).\r\n\r\n# How do you get this to work?\r\nHere we'll guide you through what you need to get this running, and how to visualize your first manifold.\r\n## The Prerequisites\r\nYou'll need this software before you can get up and running.\r\n### MATLAB\r\nFor the computations, you'll need a copy of [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). While this software costs money, you may be able to use the trial version, buy the student one, or even use a copy on college or university machines.\r\n### ParaView\r\nFor visualization, you'll need to download and install [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php). Following the previous link will help you install it for Windows and Mac, and for Debian and Ubuntu you can use\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get update\r\n$ sudo apt-get install paraview\r\n```\r\nMany other linux distributions have ParaView in the default repositories, so installation should be just as simple on those machines as well.\r\n### This Software\r\nClick one of the download links on the left side of this page and put the archive (the zip or the tar file) in a place you can find. You'll need to unzip (or untar) it. In Windows/Mac/Linux, this is usually a matter find finding the file, double clicking it, and finding some unzip (or untar) option.\r\n## My First Manifold\r\nHave you installed MATLAB and Paraview? Great! Let's visualize our first manifold.\r\n\r\n1. Your first goal is to run main.m. If you've installed the graphical MATLAB, simply open up MATLAB, click on \"file\" -> \"open\", then navigate to where you have the file and select it. Run this file: in some versions of matlab, there is a green triangle pointing right on the top bar, if you can't find that, hitting F5 will probably do the trick. MATLAB will now give you some message about changing the path or working directory, select the option that is closest to \"Change Directory\" (to the one containing main.m).\r\n\r\n2. At this point you will be prompted for several options. If you just hit enter, the default is selected. Hit enter to select the default at every prompt.\r\n\r\n3.  Just wait while the program does its work! The current progress (out of 100) will be printing onto the screen, once it reaches 100, you'll see it pause for a little as it writes the output file, and then a message will print that the file has been written.\r\n\r\n4. Open up ParaView. Click \"File\"->\"Open\", navigate to the folder that contains the program, and double click on the file \"manifold.vtk\". In the Pipeline Browser (within ParaView), select \"manifold.vtk\", then click \"Apply\" in the Properties Pane. You should see your manifold! You can change options such as coloring and whether you want to see the wireframe or not in the Properties Pane.\r\n\r\n## Visualizing Your Own Manifold\r\nBefore performing the steps in \"My First Manifold\", you'll want to edit the file myVectorField.m, which is in the same directory as main.m. Instructions for editing that file are found within the file itself.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
