{"name":"2DOptiMan","tagline":"A MATLAB program to generate an Optimal Mesh for 2D (un)stable Manifolds","body":"# What does this software do?\r\nThis project contains the files necessary to compute the stable or unstable manifold of a vector field using MATLAB, and then create a vtk file to be read by Paraview for visualization. Specifically, we consider the system \\\\( \\frac{du}{dt} = F(u(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t)) \\\\) with a fixed point where \\\\(  F(x_0, y_0 , z_0 ) = 0 \\\\). In the case of a stable manifold, we find the set of points such that as \\\\( t \\rightarrow \\infty \\\\), \\\\( u(t) -> (x_0,y_0,z_0) \\\\). In the case of the unstable manifold, we find the set of points such that as \\\\( t \\rightarrow -\\infty \\\\), \\\\( u(t) -> (x_0,y_0,z_0) \\\\).\r\n\r\n# How do you get this to work?\r\nHere we'll guide you through what you need to get this running, and how to visualize your first manifold.\r\n## The Prerequisites\r\nYou'll need this software before you can get up and running.\r\n### MATLAB\r\nFor the computations, you'll need a copy of [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/).. While this software costs money, you may be able to use the trial version, buy the student one, or even use a copy on college or university machines.\r\n### ParaView\r\nFor visualization, you'll need to download and install [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/paraview/resources/software.php). Following the previous link will help you install it for Windows and Mac, and for Debian and Ubuntu you can use\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get update\r\n$ sudo apt-get install paraview\r\n```\r\nMany other linux distributions have ParaView in the default repositories, so installation should be just as simple on those machines as well.\r\n### This Software\r\nClick one of the download links on the left side of this page and put the archive (the zip or the tar file) in a place you can find. You'll need to unzip (or untar) it. In Windows/Mac/Linux, this is usually a matter find finding the file, double clicking it, and finding some unzip (or untar) option.\r\n## My First Manifold\r\nHave you installed MATLAB and Paraview? Great! Let's visualize our first manifold.\r\n1. Your first goal is to run main.m. If you've install the graphical MATLAB, simply open up MATLAB, click on \"file\" -> \"open\", then navigate to where you have the file and select it.\r\n\r\n### Visualizing Your Own Manifold\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
